This package contains a golang/vfs compatible FileSystem that wraps 
another file system, and interprets any zip files found within it as 
directores instead, allowing dynamic access into the contents of the 
file.

This is useful in combination with the golang/vfs/httpfs module, so that 
a web server can be easily created that can serve content from zip 
inside zip files efficiently and getting all the benefits of using an 
http.FileSystem, such as Caching, etc.

The code in `zipfs/zipfs.go` is the same as in the godoc vfs with a few 
minor changes to support ReadDir on the base of the zip file and also to 
support zip.Reader instead of zip.ReadCloser. It is copyright the Go 
Authors.

The rest of the code is Copyright Allan Wirth (2014) and is released 
under the same 3-clause BSD license as go - see `LICENSE`.
